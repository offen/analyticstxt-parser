Usage: analyticstxt [subcommand [...args]] [...flags]

Where subcommand is one of the following:

  validate [filename] [...flags]

    Checks whether the given file is a valid analytics.txt file.
    Reads from stdin when `-` is given as the filename.

    Flags:
      -d, --draft       Use a non-default version of the draft.
                        This is expected to be the full draft name like
                        `draft-ring-analyticstxt-09`

  parse [filename] [...flags]

    Parses the given analytics.txt file and outputs its JSON
    representation to stdout. Reads from stdin when `-` is given as the
    filename.

    Flags:
      -d, --draft       Use a non-default version of the draft.
                        This is expected to be the full draft name like
                        `draft-ring-analyticstxt-09`

      -l, --lax         Do not validate the given file against the schema.
                        This will still error when the given document cannot
                        be parsed in the first place

  serialize [sourcefile] [outfile] [...flags]

    Reads the JSON representation of an analytics.txt file and serializes the
    contents into the canonical format. Reads from stdin when `-` is given as
    the sourcefile. If no outfile is given, the result will be written to stdout.

    Flags:
      -d, --draft       Use a non-default version of the draft.
                        This is expected to be the full draft name like
                        `draft-ring-analyticstxt-09`

      -l, --lax         Do not validate the given file against the schema.
                        This will still error when the given document cannot
                        be parsed in the first place

      -f, --force       Overwrite outfile if it already exists.

  3. Parse input from stdout and save to a file

    ./script.sh | analyticstxt parse - > analytics.json

  4. Serialize JSON input from stdin into a file named analytics.txt

    ./script.sh | analyticstxt serialize - analytics.txt
